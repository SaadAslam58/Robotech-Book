# Chapter 1: The Embodied Intelligence Shift

This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of Physical AI and the differences between digital and physical systems.

## Overview

In this chapter, we explore the paradigm shift from purely digital AI to embodied intelligence that interacts with the physical world.

## Topics Covered

- Introduction to Physical AI
- Digital vs. Physical laws and constraints
- Sensors and perception in physical systems
- The importance of embodiment in AI systems

## Key Concepts

:::info
**Physical AI** refers to AI systems that interact with and operate within the physical world, as opposed to purely digital systems like language models or recommendation engines.

## Next Steps

This chapter sets the foundation for understanding how AI systems must adapt when they operate in the physical world with its unique constraints and requirements.
