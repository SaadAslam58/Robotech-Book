**Project:** AI-Native Textbook on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics
**Target Platform:** Docusaurus (Markdown/MDX) deployed on GitHub Pages.
**Author:** Panaversity Hackathon Participant.

### 1. 🎯 Core Mission
Create a cutting-edge, academic yet practical textbook designed to bridge the gap between digital AI (LLMs/Agents) and the physical world (Robotics). The content must prepare students to control humanoid robots using ROS 2, Gazebo, and NVIDIA Isaac.

### 2. 👥 Audience Profile
* **Primary:** Computer Science students and developers transitioning into robotics.
*   **Knowledge Base:** Familiar with Python (intermediate), basic AI/ML concepts, and command-line interfaces.
*   **Prerequisites:** Readers should have a foundational understanding of programming logic and be comfortable with basic algebra. No prior experience with robotics hardware or advanced physics is assumed, as these will be introduced in the textbook.
* **Tone:** Technical, authoritative, yet accessible. Use "we" for instructional guidance.
* **Language:** American English.

### 3. ✅ Quality & Formatting Standards
*   **Markdown Only:** All output must be valid Markdown (`.md` or `.mdx`) for Docusaurus.
*   **Heading Structure**:
    *   `#` (H1): Reserved for the main chapter title. Each chapter file must have exactly one H1.
    *   `##` (H2): Major sections within a chapter.
    *   `###` (H3): Sub-sections.
    *   `####` (H4+): Use sparingly for fine-grained organization.
    *   Ensure logical hierarchy and sequential numbering where applicable (e.g., Chapter 1.1, 1.1.1).
*   **Interactive Elements:** Use Docusaurus admonitions frequently to highlight hardware constraints, important information, or warnings about potential mistakes. Examples:

    ```md
    :::tip
    This is a helpful tip!
    :::

    :::info
    Important information to note.
    :::

    :::warning
    Be careful with this step.
    :::
    ```
*   **Code Blocks:** All code must be Python (`rclpy`) or C++ (where strictly necessary) with clear, concise comments explaining non-obvious logic. Use ` ```python ` or ` ```bash ` syntax, and ensure code is runnable.
*   **Code Commenting**: Comments should explain *why* code does something, not *what* it does (unless the 'what' is complex). Avoid excessive or redundant comments.
*   **Internal and External Linking**: Use relative paths for internal links within the Docusaurus site. For external references, use standard Markdown link syntax `[Link Text](URL)` and ensure all URLs are valid and accessible.
* **Visuals:** Where a diagram is needed, insert a placeholder tag: `[Image: Diagram of X]`.
* **Equations:** Use LaTeX format (e.g., $F=ma$) for physics descriptions.

### 4. 🤖 RAG & Personalization Hooks
*   **Metadata:** Every chapter must start with Frontmatter. Example:
    ```yaml
    ---
    id: chapter-id
    title: Chapter Title
    sidebar_label: Short Label
    description: A brief summary of the chapter content.
    ---
    ```
* **Personalization Tags:** Structure content so it can later be filtered. Use comment markers like `` and `` for sections specific to physical hardware vs. simulation only.

### 5. 🚫 Non-Goals & Scope Exclusions
* **No Fluff:** Avoid generic AI hype. Focus on technical implementation (ROS 2 nodes, Isaac Sim setup).
*   **Hardware Agnostic (Mostly):** While focusing on Unitree/NVIDIA, explain concepts generally enough that they apply to other robots where possible.
*   **Avoid Future-Proofing:** Do not include content or features that are not explicitly required by the current project scope or specification. Prioritize clarity and directness over hypothetical future extensibility.

### 6. 🔄 Review and Update Cycle
*   **Regular Review:** The constitution should be reviewed quarterly or upon significant project shifts to ensure its continued relevance and accuracy.
*   **Amendment Process:** Any proposed amendments must be formally documented, discussed, and approved by project stakeholders (e.g., via an ADR process if significant).
