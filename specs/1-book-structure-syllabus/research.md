## 🔍 Research Plan for Book Structure & Syllabus Map

### 1. Research Objectives
- Gather comprehensive information on Docusaurus best practices for technical documentation structuring.
- Identify effective pedagogical approaches and curriculum design patterns for robotics education.
- Explore existing high-quality robotics documentation (e.g., ROS 2, NVIDIA Isaac Sim) to understand content organization and presentation.
- Validate and refine the proposed module breakdown and chapter topics for the "Robotech Book" based on current industry standards and educational needs.
- Determine optimal `sidebars.js` configurations for a user-friendly and scalable Docusaurus documentation site.

### 2. Key Information Sources
- **Docusaurus Official Documentation:** `docusaurus.io/docs`, GitHub repositories for Docusaurus themes and plugins.
- **Robotics Operating System (ROS 2) Official Documentation:** `docs.ros.org`, tutorials, and community forums for structure and content ideas.
- **NVIDIA Isaac Sim Documentation:** Official guides, tutorials, and API references for advanced simulation environments.
- **Academic Papers & Research:** Journals and conferences focused on robotics education, curriculum development, and technical documentation best practices (e.g., IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters, ACM Transactions on Robotics).
- **Online Robotics Courses & MOOCs:** Platforms like Coursera, edX, and Udacity to analyze syllabus structures, learning objectives, and content delivery methods.
- **GitHub Repositories:** Open-source Docusaurus projects and robotics learning resources to observe real-world implementations.

### 3. Data Collection Strategy
- **Keyword Searches:** Utilize academic databases (e.g., Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore) and web search engines with terms like "Docusaurus site structure," "robotics curriculum design," "ROS 2 documentation best practices," "NVIDIA Isaac Sim tutorials."
- **Review of Existing Docusaurus Projects:** Analyze the `sidebars.js` configurations, `docs` folder structures, and overall navigation of successful Docusaurus documentation sites.
- **Analysis of ROS 2 Package Structures and Tutorials:** Examine how different ROS 2 packages organize their documentation, tutorials, and examples to derive common patterns and best practices.
- **Content Mapping:** Map existing robotics curriculum topics to potential Docusaurus document structures to identify logical groupings and dependencies.
- **Ethical Sourcing:** All sourced information will be properly attributed, and copyrighted material will be used in accordance with fair use guidelines or with explicit permission.

### 4. Data Analysis & Synthesis
- **Comparative Analysis:** Compare Docusaurus structures, robotics curriculum designs, and documentation styles across various sources to identify strengths, weaknesses, and common patterns.
- **Pattern Recognition:** Identify recurring themes, organizational principles, and successful content delivery methods in both documentation and educational materials.
- **Gap Analysis:** Pinpoint areas where existing documentation or curriculum models are lacking or could be improved for the "Robotech Book."
- **Synthesize Best Practices:** Consolidate findings into a set of best practices for structuring technical documentation in Docusaurus and designing an effective robotics curriculum.
- **Alignment with Principles:** Ensure that the synthesized structure and content recommendations align with principles of academic rigor, clarity, and user-centric design as outlined in `constitution.md` and `spec.md`.

### 5. Expected Outcomes
- **Validated Module Breakdown:** A thoroughly researched and validated breakdown of the book into distinct modules and sub-modules.
- **Refined Chapter Topics:** A comprehensive list of chapter topics and sub-topics, ensuring logical flow and coverage of essential robotics concepts.
- **Optimal `sidebars.js` Structure Examples:** Concrete examples and recommendations for the `sidebars.js` configuration in Docusaurus to achieve intuitive navigation and scalability.
- **Content Outline:** A detailed content outline for each chapter, guiding the writing process.
- **Research Report Summary:** A summary of key findings and their implications for the book's structure and syllabus.
