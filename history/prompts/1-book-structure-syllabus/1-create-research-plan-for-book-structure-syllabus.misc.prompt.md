command: "You are an expert in Docusaurus documentation and robotics curriculum design. Your task is to create a `research.md` file within the `specs/1-book-structure-syllabus/` directory.

The `research.md` file should outline the research approach, key information sources, and the types of data to be collected for the \"Book Structure & Syllabus Map\" feature. Ensure the research approach aligns with the principles and guidelines specified in:
- `constitution.md` (e.g., academic rigor, ethical sourcing, quality standards)
- `specs/1-book-structure-syllabus/spec.md` (e.g., module breakdown, user stories)
- `specs/1-book-structure-syllabus/plan.md` (e.g., \"Research Approach\" section).

The output should be a detailed markdown file named `research.md` containing the following sections:

## 🔍 Research Plan for Book Structure & Syllabus Map

### 1. Research Objectives
- Clearly state what information needs to be gathered.

### 2. Key Information Sources
- List types of sources (e.g., Docusaurus documentation, ROS 2 official docs, academic papers, NVIDIA Isaac Sim docs).
- Provide examples of specific domains or repositories if possible (e.g., `docs.ros.org`, `docusaurus.io/docs`).

### 3. Data Collection Strategy
- Describe methods for gathering information (e.g., keyword searches, reviewing existing Docusaurus projects, analyzing ROS 2 package structures).

### 4. Data Analysis & Synthesis
- Explain how collected data will be analyzed to inform the book structure and content (e.g., identifying common patterns in documentation, best practices for robotics curriculum).

### 5. Expected Outcomes
- What the research is expected to produce (e.g., validated module breakdown, refined chapter topics, optimal `sidebars.js` structure examples).

Save the completed markdown file to `specs/1-book-structure-syllabus/research.md`."

## Prompt

You are an expert in Docusaurus documentation and robotics curriculum design. Your task is to create a `research.md` file within the `specs/1-book-structure-syllabus/` directory.

The `research.md` file should outline the research approach, key information sources, and the types of data to be collected for the "Book Structure & Syllabus Map" feature. Ensure the research approach aligns with the principles and guidelines specified in:
- `constitution.md` (e.g., academic rigor, ethical sourcing, quality standards)
- `specs/1-book-structure-syllabus/spec.md` (e.g., module breakdown, user stories)
- `specs/1-book-structure-syllabus/plan.md` (e.g., "Research Approach" section).

The output should be a detailed markdown file named `research.md` containing the following sections:

## 🔍 Research Plan for Book Structure & Syllabus Map

### 1. Research Objectives

Save the completed markdown file to `specs/1-book-structure-syllabus/research.md`.

## Response snapshot

The `research.md` file has been created at `D:\\Programming\\Q-4\\Robotech-Book\\specs\\1-book-structure-syllabus\\research.md`. This file outlines the research approach, key information sources, data collection strategy, data analysis, and expected outcomes for the "Book Structure & Syllabus Map" feature.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created a detailed research plan for the book structure and syllabus.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: Created one new markdown file: `research.md`.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Review of the generated research plan, further development of spec/plan/tasks based on research outcomes.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully created the research plan document as per user instructions. Ensured alignment with project principles by incorporating best practices for academic rigor and ethical sourcing.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: N/A
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
